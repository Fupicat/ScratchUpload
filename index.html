  <h4>ScratchUpload has shut down</h4>
  <p>The wikimedia redirect exploit which I used to make this site work has been patched and doesn't work anymore, so the upload method I used is now outdated.</p>
  <p>For hosting images on the Scratch forums, I recommend <a href='https://github.com/JeffaloBob/scratch-image-uploader'>JeffaloBob's Extansion/Userscript</a>! It's a lot more user-friendly than this site could ever dream to be.</p>
  <p>If you still want to see the old homepage for this site for some reason (even though it does not work anymore), you can go <a href="old.html">here</a>.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>You can look through the code yourself <a href="https://github.com/Fupicat/ScratchUpload">here</a>.</p>
  <p>You can reach me via my <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Fupicat">Scratch profile</a> or email: fupicat at gmail dot com.</p>
